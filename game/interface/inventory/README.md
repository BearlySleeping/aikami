# Inventory System

## Overview
The Inventory System is designed to manage the collection of items that a player can acquire in the game. It provides functionalities for adding, removing, and querying items within a player's inventory.

## Features
- **Add Items**: Allows players to add items to their inventory either through gameplay, purchasing, or as rewards.
- **Remove Items**: Players can remove items from their inventory, either to make space or to use them (e.g., consuming food or potions).
- **Item Stacking**: Similar items can stack in the inventory to save space, with configurable stack limits.
- **Inventory Limits**: The inventory has a maximum capacity, which can be increased through gameplay upgrades.
- **Item Sorting**: Players can sort their inventory based on item type, value, or other attributes.
- **Search Functionality**: Includes a search bar to quickly find items within the inventory.

## How It Works
### Data Structure
The inventory system uses a list (or array) to store item objects. Each item object contains:
- **ID**: A unique identifier for the item.
- **Name**: The display name of the item.
- **Quantity**: Current stack quantity.
- **MaxStack**: Maximum number of items that can stack in a single inventory slot.

### Adding Items
When an item is added to the inventory, the system checks if the item already exists:
- If it does, and the total quantity does not exceed the `MaxStack`, it increments the quantity.
- If the total exceeds `MaxStack`, it creates a new slot (if inventory space permits).

### Removing Items
To remove an item, the system decrements the quantity from the relevant item stack. If the quantity reaches zero, the item is removed from the inventory.

### Sorting and Searching
Sorting is implemented using a sorting algorithm based on the selected attribute (e.g., quicksort for numerical values). Searching is performed using a simple loop to match the search query with item names or attributes.

## Configuration
The inventory system can be configured with the following settings:
- **MaxCapacity**: The maximum number of slots in the inventory.
- **DefaultMaxStack**: Default maximum stack size for items that do not specify their own.

## Usage
To interact with the inventory system, players use a graphical interface where items can be dragged and dropped between slots or right-clicked for options like "Use" or "Remove".

## Dependencies
- Game Engine (specify version)
- Database for storing player items (if applicable)
