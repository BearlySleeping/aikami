# AiKami - A Pixel 2D Top-Down RPG

## Introduction

AiKami aims at creating a pixel 2D top-down RPG game where all NPCs and sprites are generated using AI. Inspired by the D&D similar to the Baldurs Gate series, AiKami seeks to create a rich and immersive world where players can explore, battle, and interact with AI-driven characters.

## Project Stack

-   **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)**: The core game is developed in Godot with GDScript
-   **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)**: For AI functionalities, including NPC and sprite generation, we leverage Hugging Face transformers library.
-   **[Bun](https://bun.sh)**: We use bun and typescript to run commands to generate images outside godot for internal use. In ai folder.

## Development Roadmap

See the roadmap [here](https://github.com/users/BearlySleeping/projects/1)

Overall what is next is:

-   **Voice Generation**: Bringing unique voices to our AI-generated NPCs.
-   **Combat System**: Refining the AI-driven combat to be dynamic and engaging.
-   **Inventory Management**: Creating an intuitive and expansive inventory system.
-   **Level System**: Developing a comprehensive level-up system that rewards player progression.
-   **Races & Classes**: Incorporating a variety of races and classes for players to choose from, each with unique abilities and lore.
