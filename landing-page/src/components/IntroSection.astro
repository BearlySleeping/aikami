		AiKami aims to create a pixel 2D top-down RPG game where all NPCs and
		sprites are generated using AI. Inspired by D&D games like the Baldur's
		Gate series, AiKami seeks to create a rich and immersive world where
		players can explore, battle, and interact with AI-driven characters. The
		unique aspect of AiKami is that NPCs have their own beliefs,
		personalities, and strategies, and they interact with the player and the
		world based on these attributes.

		Imagine a D&D RPG game like Baldur's Gate or Divinity, except you cannot
		control any NPCs, allies, or enemies, nor can you force trades, battles,
		etc. NPCs must want to help you, and they will follow their own
		strategies that align with their beliefs, trust in you, etc. All actions
		are driven by AI. There will be no prewritten dialogs; all interactions
		will be dynamically generated with AI. However, there will still be a
		story and a plot since NPCs will have agendas, backgrounds, lore, goals,
		etc. There will be quests for players to embark on, creating a rich and
		evolving narrative experience.

	<h3 class="mb-3 text-3xl font-bold">Examples of Gameplay Dynamics</h3>
	<ul class="mb-5 list-inside list-disc text-lg">
		<li>
			Relationship-Driven Actions: You are in a battle with your squad.
			The night before, you stole from your healer. They found out and now
			dislike you, resulting in them being less inclined to heal you.
		</li>
		<li>
			Contextual Decision Making: You insult a trader, and he will charge
			you more. Smooth talk him, and he might give you a discount.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ally Dynamics: Any NPC can become your ally and may leave you if
			they no longer like you. If an NPC idolizes you, they might
			sacrifice themselves for your safety.
		</li>
		<li>
			Fear and Bravery: If a person is very scared, they will stay at the
			back during fights. You can train them to become braver over time.
		</li>
	</ul>

		Additional Features and Creative Examples
	</h3>
	<ul class="list-inside list-disc text-lg">
		<li>
			Dynamic Quests: Quests in AiKami are not static. An NPC might give
			you a quest based on their current needs or fears. For instance, a
			blacksmith might ask for rare materials only if his current stock is
			low, or a farmer might seek help with a pest problem that arises
			randomly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Evolving World: The game world evolves with or without the player's
			direct interaction. Towns can grow or shrink based on economic
			conditions driven by NPCs. Natural disasters or bandit raids might
			change the landscape and NPC settlements.
		</li>
		<li>
			Emotional Depth: NPCs have emotional states that influence their
			interactions. An NPC who has just lost a loved one might refuse to
			speak to you or might be driven to seek revenge, influencing the
			storyline dynamically.
		</li>
		<li>
			Reputation System: Your actions influence your reputation across
			different regions. Save a village from a dragon, and you might be
			celebrated as a hero, gaining discounts and allies. Betray a trust,
			and you might find doors closed and prices higher in certain towns.
		</li>
		<li>
			AI-Generated Lore: The game generates its lore dynamically.
			Historical events, myths, and legends are created by the AI,
			providing a unique backstory every time you play.
		</li>
